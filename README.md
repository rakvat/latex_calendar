## Python LatexCalendar

Similar to the Python [HTMLCalendar](https://docs.python.org/2/library/calendar.html#calendar.HTMLCalendar) this creates a LaTeX calendar, that can be converted into a printable PDF.

It also allows to integrate recurrent yearly events like birthdays or holidays. See /input for an example.
